# Neural Network from Scratch in R

This repo contains a fully commented R script that demonstrates how to build, train, and visualize a basic feedforward neural network without using any machine learning libraries. Since there's so many comments in the code, I'm not going to put a lot of detail here. You can also read about it in my blog post - https://blog.marketingdatascience.ai/neural-networks-explained-from-first-principles-in-r-795bc158cf37.

The dataset simulates a simplified marketing scenario: determining whether an ad campaign is successful based on two featuresâ€”budget intensity and audience engagement.
